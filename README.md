# Gesture Volume Control

Hand Gesture Volume Control | Open CV | Computer Vision

Use gesture control to change the volume of a computer. First we look into hand tracking and then we use hand landmarks to find gestures of our hand to change volume.

Distance between index finger and thumb is used to change volume level and ring finger is used to set the volume if ring finger is down/close volume will be set to volume which is on virtual volume bar.
